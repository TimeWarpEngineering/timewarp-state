+`services.AddScoped<TimerState>();`  Is NOT needed as states are automatically registered.  Also there is a source generator that automatically generates a corresponding method on State for each ActionSet that turns the Send(new xxxx) code into a normal fucntion call.

+LoadedStateFQDN is crap name use `TypeName`

+I rolled back the TimerState changes.  Instead of a parameterless constructor I think it makes more sense to implement ICloneable.  And in this case we reuse the values from existing object for all the intjected params.

# 2024-09-08 23:57:17.185603
+The Dictionary needs to be a deep clone.

# 2024-09-08 23:58:11.629935
+hmmm the problem is that I think the elapsed time on a cloned timer will be reset.

# 2024-09-08 23:59:57.659505
+actually lets simply not clone the Dictionary at all.  We implement `ICloneable` but we just reuse the dictionary.

# 2024-09-09 00:00:54.423761
+and now we don't need TimerWrapper either

# 2024-09-09 00:05:50.524433
+could you update the comments on the Clone method to be more clear and use XMLDoc style?
