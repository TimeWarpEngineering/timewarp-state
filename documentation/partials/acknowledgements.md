## Acknowledgements

Peter Morris and I have been friends for many years.
He is an amazing developer and a person who has taught me a great deal.
Not surprisingly, Pete and I think a lot a like.
We both, independently, started working on our own State Management
components. Although I started first. :P
Pete's component attempts to solve most of the same problems.
TimeWarp.State draws on the strengths of a proven async pipeline in Mediator, where as Fluxor
implements its own middleware.  
If TimeWarp.State does not meet your needs be sure to checkout Fluxor.
