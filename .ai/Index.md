## Purpose of the .ai folder

The `.ai` folder is specifically designed to contain documents intended for Large Language Model (LLM) consumption. These files provide context, guidelines, and structured information about the project, which helps LLMs like myself to better understand and assist with the project.

The contents of this folder are not typically used directly by the application or developers during normal development. Instead, they serve as a knowledge base for AI assistants, enabling more accurate and context-aware responses when working on the project.

## Usage

When interacting with an AI assistant about this project, you can refer to the contents of the `.ai` folder or ask the AI to consider specific files within this folder for more informed assistance.
