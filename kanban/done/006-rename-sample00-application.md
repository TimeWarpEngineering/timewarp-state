# Task 006: Rename Sample00 Application to Sample00Auto

## Description

Rename the Sample00 Application to Sample00Auto to maintain consistency with the Server and Wasm naming conventions in the project structure.

## Requirements

- Rename the Sample00 Application directory to Sample00Auto
- Update any references to the application name in configuration files
- Ensure build and test processes continue to work after the rename

## Checklist

### Design
- [ ] Review all references to Sample00 in the codebase
- [ ] Plan the renaming strategy to minimize impact

### Implementation
- [ ] Rename the application directory
- [ ] Update project references
- [ ] Update solution files
- [ ] Update any import statements or namespaces
- [ ] Update build scripts if necessary
- [ ] Verify build process works
- [ ] Run tests to ensure no regressions

### Documentation
- [ ] Update documentation references
- [ ] Update any example code or tutorials

### Review
- [ ] Consider CI/CD Implications
- [ ] Code Review
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Ensure no broken references

## Notes

The rename is needed to maintain consistent naming conventions across the project, where Server and Wasm components already follow this pattern.

## Implementation Notes
