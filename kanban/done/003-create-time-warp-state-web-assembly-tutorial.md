# Task 003: Create TimeWarp.State WebAssembly Tutorial

## Description
Create a comprehensive tutorial for TimeWarp.State that demonstrates building a Blazor application with state management in Interactive WebAssembly mode. The tutorial will showcase how to implement state management specifically for WebAssembly-based Blazor applications.

## Requirements
- Tutorial must be clear and beginner-friendly
- Cover essential TimeWarp.State concepts in WebAssembly context:
  1. State class implementation and initialization
  2. Action definition and structure
  3. Handler implementation for state mutation
  4. Component integration with TimeWarpStateComponent
  5. Pipeline flow: Component -> Action -> Handler -> State
  6. State immutability and proper mutation patterns
- Include practical, working examples
- Provide clear explanations for each step
- Follow consistent naming convention
- Focus on Interactive WebAssembly render mode specifics
- Address WebAssembly-specific considerations:
  * Client-side state management
  * Browser storage integration
  * Performance optimization
  * Download size considerations
