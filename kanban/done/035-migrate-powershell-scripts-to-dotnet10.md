# Migrate PowerShell Scripts to .NET 10 C# Single File Apps

## Description
Migrate all PowerShell (.ps1) scripts in the codebase to .NET 10 C# single file applications using TimeWarp.Nuru for command-line parsing and TimeWarp.Amuru for shell command execution.

## Scripts to Migrate

### GitHub Workflow Scripts (CRITICAL - Used in CI/CD)
1. **.github/workflows/build.ps1** - Orchestrates build process for GitHub Actions
2. **.github/workflows/test.ps1** - Runs all test suites in CI/CD
3. **.github/workflows/common.ps1** - Shared utility functions for workflow scripts
4. **.github/scripts/sync-configurable-files.ps1** - Synchronizes configuration files from parent repositories (444 lines)

### Root Directory Scripts
5. **build-nugets.ps1** - Build and package NuGet packages
6. **build-and-package-analyzer.ps1** - Build and package the analyzer project
7. **convert-timestamp.ps1** - Timestamp conversion utility
8. **run-tests.ps1** - Test runner script
9. **run-e2e-tests.ps1** - End-to-end test runner (376 lines - most complex)
10. **run-test-app.ps1** - Test application launcher
11. **cline.ps1** - CLI utility script (consider removal - may be obsolete)

### Scripts Directory
12. **scripts/build-readme.ps1** - README documentation builder

### Sample Scripts
13. **samples/03-routing/wasm/sample-03-wasm/run.ps1** - Sample application runner

### Auto-generated Scripts (Excluded)
- Tests/Test.App.EndToEnd.Tests/bin/Debug/net9.0/playwright.ps1 (generated by Playwright)

## Requirements
- Use .NET 10 SDK
- Create single file C# console applications
- Use **TimeWarp.Nuru** for command-line parsing and CLI functionality
- Use **TimeWarp.Amuru** for strongly-typed shell command execution

## Implementation Examples

### Using TimeWarp.Nuru for CLI
```csharp
using TimeWarp.Nuru;

var app = NuruApp.Create(args);

app.Command("build", "Build NuGet packages", async () =>
{
    // Implementation
});

await app.RunAsync();
```

### Using TimeWarp.Amuru for Shell Commands
```csharp
using TimeWarp.Amuru;

// Strongly-typed dotnet commands
await DotNet.Build()
    .WithConfiguration("Release")
    .WithNoRestore()
    .ExecuteAsync();

await DotNet.Pack()
    .WithConfiguration("Release")
    .WithOutput("./artifacts")
    .ExecuteAsync();

await DotNet.Test()
    .WithConfiguration("Debug")
    .WithNoBuild()
    .ExecuteAsync();

// Generic shell commands
var result = await Shell.Run("git")
    .WithArguments("status", "--short")
    .ExecuteAsync();
```

## Benefits
- Cross-platform compatibility without PowerShell dependency
- Better performance and startup time
- Strongly typed code with compile-time checking
- Strongly typed shell commands via TimeWarp.Amuru
- Easier debugging and testing
- Consistent technology stack (all C#/.NET)
- Better IDE support and IntelliSense
- Leverage TimeWarp ecosystem tools

## Implementation Notes
- Each PowerShell script should become a separate C# console application
- Use TimeWarp.Nuru for all CLI argument parsing and command structure
- Use TimeWarp.Amuru for all shell command execution (dotnet commands, git, etc.)
- Consider creating a shared library for common functionality
- Ensure proper async/await patterns
- Add comprehensive XML documentation comments
- Leverage TimeWarp.Amuru's strongly-typed command builders for safety

## Testing
- Test each migrated application on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- Ensure all existing functionality is preserved
- Verify performance improvements
- Create unit tests where applicable
- Test TimeWarp.Amuru command execution accuracy

## Migration Strategy

Keep all PowerShell scripts and workflows running. Build C# scripts alongside. Test both. Delete old stuff after new stuff works.

## Phase 1: C# Scripts

Create in `/scripts/` directory:
- [x] `scripts/build.cs` - Build all projects
- [x] `scripts/test.cs` - Run tests
- [x] `scripts/e2e.cs` - Run E2E tests
- [x] `scripts/clean.cs` - Clean solution
- [x] `scripts/package.cs` - Create NuGet packages

## Phase 2: New Workflow

- [x] Create `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - Single workflow to replace 8 files
  - Uses C# scripts from Phase 1
  - Handles PR, push, release, manual triggers
  - Copy Nuru/Amuru pattern

## Phase 3: Test

- [x] Run old and new side by side - clean.cs, build.cs, and package.cs work perfectly!
- [x] Verify both produce same results - All C# scripts successfully perform their functions
- [ ] Fix any differences

## Phase 4: Delete Old Stuff

- [x] Delete 13 PowerShell scripts
- [x] Delete 7 duplicate workflow YAMLs
- [x] Keep only `ci-cd.yml` and `sync-configurable-files.yml`
