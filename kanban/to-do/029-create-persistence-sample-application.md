# Task 029: Create Persistence Sample Application

## Description

- Create a sample application demonstrating the Persistence features of TimeWarp.State.
- This sample will showcase how to implement and use state persistence in a TimeWarp.State application.
- Demonstrate both Session and Local storage options for state persistence.

## Requirements

- Create a new sample project in the Samples directory.
- Implement a simple application state that can be persisted.
- Demonstrate how to save state to both Session storage and Local storage.
- Demonstrate how to load persisted state from both storage options on application startup.
- Showcase how to handle state migrations if the state structure changes.
- Include clear comments and documentation within the sample code.
- Provide examples of when to use Session storage vs Local storage.

## Checklist

### Design
- [ ] Design the sample application structure
- [ ] Define the state model to be persisted
- [ ] Plan the persistence logic for both Session and Local storage
- [ ] Design state loading/saving flow for both storage options

### Implementation
- [ ] Create new sample project in the Samples directory
- [ ] Implement the application state
- [ ] Add persistence logic using TimeWarp.State features for Session storage
- [ ] Add persistence logic using TimeWarp.State features for Local storage
- [ ] Implement state loading on application startup for both storage options
- [ ] Add example of state migration handling
- [ ] Ensure all persistence features are properly demonstrated for both storage types

### Documentation
- [ ] Add inline comments explaining key concepts and implementation details
- [ ] Create a README.md file for the sample project explaining how to run and use the sample
- [ ] Update main documentation to reference the new Persistence sample
- [ ] Document the differences and use cases for Session vs Local storage

### Review
- [ ] Verify that all persistence features are correctly implemented for both storage options
- [ ] Ensure the sample is easy to understand and follow
- [ ] Consider performance implications of persistence implementation
- [ ] Consider security implications of persisting state in different storage options
- [ ] Conduct code review

## Notes

- Refer to the existing TimeWarp.State documentation on persistence features.
- Consider common use cases for state persistence in Blazor applications.
- Highlight scenarios where Session storage might be preferred over Local storage and vice versa.

## Implementation Notes

- To be added during implementation.
