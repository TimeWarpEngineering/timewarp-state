http://localhost:11434/# Task 028: Implement INotifications Toast Sample

## Description

Create a sample demonstrating the implementation of INotifications in TimeWarp.State using toast notifications as the user interface element. This will showcase how to handle system notifications in a Blazor application using TimeWarp.State's notification system.

## Requirements

- Create a new sample project demonstrating INotifications
- Implement toast notifications using a popular toast library (e.g., Blazored.Toast)
- Show different types of notifications (success, error, info, warning)
- Demonstrate how to trigger notifications from different parts of the application
- Include examples of both immediate and delayed notifications
- Show how to handle notification queuing and dismissal

## Checklist

### Design
- [ ] Create sample application structure
- [ ] Design notification state and actions
- [ ] Plan notification UI components
- [ ] Design notification service integration

### Implementation
- [ ] Create new sample project structure
- [ ] Add toast notification library dependency
- [ ] Implement notification state management
- [ ] Create notification actions and handlers
- [ ] Implement toast UI components
- [ ] Add example scenarios demonstrating different notification types
- [ ] Implement notification service
- [ ] Add notification queuing system

### Documentation
- [ ] Add README.md for the sample
- [ ] Document notification patterns and best practices
- [ ] Add inline code documentation
- [ ] Create usage examples

### Review
- [ ] Consider Accessibility Implications
  - Ensure notifications are screen-reader friendly
  - Implement proper ARIA attributes
  - Consider notification duration and dismissal options
- [ ] Consider Performance Implications
  - Evaluate notification queuing performance
  - Assess memory usage for notification storage
- [ ] Consider Security Implications
  - Review notification content sanitization
  - Assess potential security risks
- [ ] Code Review

## Notes

- This sample will serve as a reference implementation for handling system notifications in TimeWarp.State applications
- Consider implementing different notification strategies (immediate vs queued)
- Show integration with application state management
- Demonstrate proper notification lifecycle management

## Implementation Notes

- To be added during implementation
