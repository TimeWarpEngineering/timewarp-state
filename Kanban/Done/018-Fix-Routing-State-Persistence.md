# Task 018: Fix Routing State Persistence

## Description

Fix state persistence issue in Sample03-Routing where state resets when navigating between pages. Currently, the counter value resets to 0 after navigation when it should maintain its previous value.

## Requirements

- Investigate why state is not persisting during navigation
- Fix state persistence in Sample03-Routing
- Ensure counter value maintains its value across page navigation
- Update any relevant documentation

## Checklist

### Design
- [ ] Review current routing implementation
- [ ] Analyze state management during navigation
- [ ] Design solution for state persistence

### Implementation
- [ ] Fix state persistence issue
- [ ] Add tests to verify state persistence across navigation
- [ ] Update sample documentation if needed

### Testing
- [ ] Verify counter state persists after navigation
- [ ] Test other state values persist correctly
- [ ] Run all tests to ensure no regressions

### Documentation
- [ ] Update any relevant documentation
- [ ] Add notes about state persistence in routing documentation
- [ ] Update sample comments if needed

## Notes

- Issue discovered during production release preparation
- Counter resets to 0 when navigating away and back
- Should maintain state across navigation
- Part of production readiness requirements

## Implementation Notes

- Add implementation notes as the task progresses
