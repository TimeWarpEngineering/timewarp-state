# Task 016: Create Sample03Wasm Tutorial

## Description

Create a comprehensive tutorial that guides users through building Sample03Wasm, demonstrating TimeWarp.State.Plus's routing capabilities. The tutorial will build upon the ReduxDevTools sample, showing how to implement stack-based navigation management with features like breadcrumb navigation, direct route changes, and back navigation.

## Requirements

- Tutorial must follow the progression from ReduxDevTools sample to routing implementation
- Cover all key routing features:
  * Stack-based navigation
  * Breadcrumb navigation
  * Direct route changes
  * Back navigation
  * Thread-safe route updates
  * Page title synchronization
- Include implementation of core routing actions:
  * ChangeRoute
  * GoBack
  * PushRouteInfo
- Demonstrate integration with:
  * Blazor's NavigationManager
  * ReduxDevTools for route debugging
  * Built-in logging support

## Checklist

### Design
- [x] Review Sample01Wasm (ReduxDevTools) implementation
- [x] Review Sample03Wasm routing implementation
- [x] Map progression path from ReduxDevTools to routing features
- [x] Identify key learning points and concepts

### Implementation
- [x] Create step-by-step tutorial structure
- [x] Document initial setup from ReduxDevTools base
- [x] Detail routing feature implementation steps
- [x] Include code samples for each routing action
- [x] Add configuration and integration steps
- [x] Include thread safety implementation details
- [x] Document ReduxDevTools integration for route debugging

### Documentation
- [x] Add tutorial to Documentation/Tutorial folder
- [x] Include screenshots of:
  * Route state in ReduxDevTools
  * Breadcrumb navigation
  * Navigation stack visualization
- [x] Add diagrams explaining:
  * Stack-based navigation flow
  * Route state management
- [x] Include troubleshooting section
- [x] Add best practices section
- [x] Cross-reference with existing tutorials

### Review
- [x] Verify tutorial progression logic
- [x] Test all code samples
- [x] Validate ReduxDevTools integration steps
- [x] Review thread safety explanations
- [x] Check clarity of routing concepts
- [x] Ensure consistency with existing documentation

## Notes

- Base tutorial structure on existing Sample01Wasm (ReduxDevTools) tutorial format
- Focus on explaining the transition from basic state management to advanced routing features
- Include practical examples demonstrating real-world routing scenarios
- Emphasize debugging capabilities through ReduxDevTools integration
- Include examples of common routing patterns and their implementation

## Implementation Notes

- To be added during implementation
