# Task 007: Create Action Tracking Tutorial and Sample

## Description

Create a step-by-step tutorial in the README explaining how to implement Action Tracking, followed by creating a sample application that demonstrates these concepts. This will help developers understand how to utilize the Action Tracking Feature from TimeWarp.State.Plus in their applications.

## Requirements

Phase 1 - Tutorial Creation:
- Create a detailed tutorial in the README that explains:
  - What Action Tracking is and its benefits
  - How to use the existing ActionTrackingState from TimeWarp.State.Plus
  - Step-by-step guide for implementing tracked actions
  - How to display and manage action tracking information

Phase 2 - Sample Implementation:
- Create a sample application based on Sample00Wasm that implements the concepts from the tutorial
- Demonstrate practical usage of action tracking features

## Checklist

### Phase 1 - Tutorial
- [x] Research and outline tutorial structure
- [x] Document Action Tracking concept overview
- [x] Write step-by-step implementation guide:
  - [x] Adding TimeWarp.State.Plus package
  - [x] Creating trackable actions
  - [x] Using TrackActionAttribute
  - [x] Configuring ActionTrackingBehavior
  - [x] Displaying tracking information
- [x] Include code snippets and examples
- [x] Add troubleshooting section
- [x] Review and refine tutorial content

### Phase 2 - Sample Implementation
- [x] Create new sample project based on Sample00Wasm
- [x] Implement features following tutorial steps:
  - [x] Create State with tracked actions
  - [x] Implement sample actions (TwoSecondAction, FiveSecondAction)
  - [x] Add tracking configuration
  - [x] Create UI components
- [x] Verify implementation matches tutorial
- [x] Test and validate functionality

### Documentation

- [x] Test build and run process

## Notes

Reference implementations:
- Tests/Test.App/Test.App.Client/Pages/ActiveActionsPage.razor
- Source/TimeWarp.State.Plus/Features/ActionTracking/ActionTrackingState/ActionTrackingState.cs
- Source/TimeWarp.State.Plus/Features/ActionTracking/Pipeline/ActionTrackingBehavior.cs
- Source/TimeWarp.State.Plus/Features/ActionTracking/Pipeline/TrackActionAttribute.cs

Tutorial should cover:
- Action Tracking concept explanation
- Using existing ActionTrackingState
- Creating trackable actions
- Implementing tracking display
- Error handling
- Best practices

Sample should demonstrate:
- Practical implementation of tutorial concepts
- Multiple action duration scenarios
- Concurrent action handling
- Error handling scenarios

## Implementation Notes

Tutorial considerations:
1. Focus on clarity and step-by-step progression
2. Include practical examples
3. Explain why each step is necessary
4. Address common pitfalls

Sample considerations:
1. Follow tutorial structure exactly
2. Demonstrate practical usage
3. Include error handling examples
4. Show concurrent action tracking
