# Task 019: Fix Auto Sample Project Structure

## Description

Implement the project structure defined in the updated Readme for Sample00-StateActionHandler Auto. The documentation now correctly describes the Blazor Auto project structure, and we need to ensure the implementation matches.

## Requirements

- Implement project structure as documented in updated Readme
- Ensure all package references are correct
- Verify functionality matches documentation
- Ensure smooth transition between Server and WebAssembly modes

## Checklist

### Design
- [x] Review current project structure
- [x] Compare with Blazor Auto project templates
- [x] Identify structural issues
- [x] Plan necessary changes (documented in Readme)

### Implementation
- [x] Create project structure following updated Readme:
  - [x] Set up Sample00Auto.Client project
  - [x] Set up Sample00Auto server project
  - [x] Configure proper project references
  - [x] Implement GlobalUsings.cs files
  - [x] Configure Program.cs files
  - [x] Set up Routes.razor
- [x] Update package references to 11.0.0
- [x] Verify build process
- [x] Test Auto functionality

### Testing
- [x] Verify project builds correctly
- [x] Test Auto render mode functionality:
  - [x] Initial server-side rendering
  - [x] Transition to WebAssembly
  - [x] State management during transition
- [x] Verify state management works in both modes
- [x] Run all tests to ensure no regressions

### Documentation
- [x] Update project documentation
- [x] Fix any invalid file links
- [x] Update sample README with correct structure
- [x] Add notes about Auto project structure

## Notes

- Documentation has been updated with correct project structure
- Readme now includes:
  - Proper project organization
  - Required GlobalUsings.cs configurations
  - Program.cs setup for both Client and Server
  - Routes.razor configuration
  - State management implementation
- Implementation matches updated documentation
- Part of production readiness requirements

## Implementation Notes

- Documentation updated with correct project structure and instructions
- Readme now provides clear guidance for:
  - Project creation and setup
  - Package installation
  - Service configuration
  - State implementation
  - Auto render mode behavior
- Verification completed:
  - Project structure implemented as documented
  - Server runs successfully on localhost
  - Client-side navigation works between all pages
  - State management works correctly (verified with Counter component)
  - Data display functions properly (verified with Weather component)
  - Proper separation of Client/Server projects maintained
