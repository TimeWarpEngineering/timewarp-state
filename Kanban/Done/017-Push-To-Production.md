# Task 017: Push To Production

## Description

Prepare TimeWarp.State for production release by updating version numbers, removing prerelease flags, and ensuring all production readiness requirements are met.

## Requirements

- Update version in Directory.Build.props from 11.0.0-beta.96+8.0.403 to 11.0.0
- Remove --prerelease flags from all sample project package references
- Ensure all documentation is up to date
- Verify all samples are working with production version
- Update release notes

## Summary of Blocking Issues

1. Critical Issues (New Tasks Created):
   - Task 018: Fix Sample03-Routing state persistence issue (state resets during navigation)
   - Task 019: Fix Sample00-StateActionHandler Auto project structure
   - Task 020: Fix 36 documentation warnings for invalid links and cross-references

2. Path to Production:
   - Complete Tasks 018, 019, and 020
   - Re-verify all samples with fixes applied
   - Final review of documentation with all warnings resolved
   - Conduct final security and performance review
   - Test package installation in a new project
   - Release to production

  - TimeWarp.State.Analyzer.Tests: 4 passed
  - TimeWarp.State.Tests: 16 passed, 1 skipped
