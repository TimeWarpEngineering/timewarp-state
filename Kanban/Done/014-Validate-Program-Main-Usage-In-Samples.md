# Task 014: Validate --program-main Usage in Samples

## Description

Ensure all samples are consistently using the --program-main approach in both code implementation and documentation instructions.

## Requirements

- Review all sample projects for --program-main usage
- Verify both code implementations and documentation reflect the correct usage
- Ensure consistency across all samples

## Checklist

### Design
- [ ] Review current --program-main implementation in samples
- [ ] Identify any inconsistencies or missing implementations

### Implementation
- [ ] Update sample projects to use --program-main where missing
- [ ] Standardize implementation across all samples
- [ ] Verify each sample builds and runs correctly

### Documentation
- [ ] Update sample documentation to reflect --program-main usage
- [ ] Ensure README files in sample directories mention --program-main
- [ ] Update any related tutorial content

### Review
- [ ] Verify all samples work as expected
- [ ] Code Review
- [ ] Documentation Review

## Notes

The --program-main approach is important for proper application initialization and should be consistently implemented across all sample projects to demonstrate best practices.

## Implementation Notes

- List of samples to review:
  - Sample 00-StateActionHandler
  - Sample 01-ReduxDevTools
  - Sample 02-ActionTracking
  - Sample 03-Routing
