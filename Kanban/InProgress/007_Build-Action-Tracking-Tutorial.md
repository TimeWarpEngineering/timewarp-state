# Task 007: Build Action Tracking Tutorial

## Description
Create a comprehensive tutorial that demonstrates how to use TimeWarp.State.Plus's Action Tracking feature. This tutorial will show users how to track and monitor action states, implement loading indicators, and manage concurrent actions in their Blazor applications.

## Requirements
- Prerequisites must be clearly stated:
  1. Completed Sample00 StateActionHandler tutorial
  2. Understanding of basic TimeWarp.State concepts
  3. TimeWarp.State.Plus package installed
- Tutorial must cover:
  1. Setting up Action Tracking with TimeWarp.State.Plus
  2. Using the TrackAction attribute
  3. Implementing loading states
  4. Monitoring concurrent actions
  5. Handling action completion states
- Include practical demonstrations of:
  1. Creating tracked actions
  2. Implementing UI loading indicators
  3. Managing multiple concurrent actions
  4. Error handling with tracked actions
- Follow consistent naming convention:
  * Use 'Sample02' for the project name
  * Maintain alignment with tutorial directory structure

## Checklist

### Design
- [ ] Review existing tutorials structure
- [ ] Plan Action Tracking implementation steps
- [ ] Design clear examples of tracked actions
- [ ] Create sample scenarios for concurrent actions

### Implementation
- [ ] Basic project setup instructions including TimeWarp.State.Plus installation
- [ ] Action Tracking configuration with TimeWarp.State.Plus
- [ ] Sample tracked action implementation
- [ ] Loading indicator components
- [ ] Concurrent action handling
- [ ] Error state management

### Documentation
- [ ] Create step-by-step tutorial documentation
- [ ] Add code samples and explanations
- [ ] Include best practices and patterns
- [ ] Document common pitfalls and solutions

### Review
- [ ] Test tutorial walkthrough
- [ ] Verify all code samples work
- [ ] Check documentation clarity
- [ ] Ensure consistent style with other tutorials

## Notes
- Base implementation exists in:
  1. Test.App.Client/Features/Application/ApplicationState
  2. Test.App.Client/Pages/ActiveActionsPage.razor
- Key concepts to document:
  1. TimeWarp.State.Plus package setup and configuration
  2. TrackAction attribute usage
  3. ActionTrackingState integration
  4. UI feedback patterns
  5. Concurrent action management
- Include examples showing:
  1. Simple tracked action
  2. Multiple concurrent actions
  3. Loading state management
  4. Error handling patterns

## Implementation Notes
- Tutorial should emphasize practical use cases for action tracking
- Clear explanation needed for the relationship between actions and their tracking states
- Include guidance on best practices for user feedback during long-running operations
