## Notes

- This release marks the transition from beta to production for version 11.0.0
- All samples should be updated to use the production version
- Documentation should reflect production status
- Consider creating a release checklist template for future releases
- Sample00-StateActionHandler Auto needs investigation for project structure issues
- Sample03-Routing state persistence issue needs investigation before production release
- All test suites passing with expected skipped tests:
  - TimeWarp.State.Analyzer.Tests: 4 passed
  - TimeWarp.State.Tests: 16 passed, 1 skipped
  - TimeWarp.State.Plus.Tests: 8 passed, 1 skipped
  - Client.Integration.Tests: 11 passed, 1 skipped

- Built and published NuGet packages version 11.0.0 to local feed
- Verified Sample00-StateActionHandler Server working with production version
- Noted issue with Sample00-StateActionHandler Auto project structure - needs investigation
- Verified Sample00-StateActionHandler Wasm working with production version - counter functionality working as expected
- Verified Sample01-ReduxDevTools working with production version:
  - Base counter functionality working correctly
  - Redux DevTools integration properly warns when DevTools not installed (expected behavior)
- Verified Sample02-ActionTracking working with production version:
  - Counter functionality working correctly
  - Action tracking state updates properly
  - Both 2-second and 5-second actions work as expected
  - Active action status displayed correctly
- Tested Sample03-Routing with production version:

  - Architecture tests passing
  - Integration tests passing
  - Only expected example tests skipped
