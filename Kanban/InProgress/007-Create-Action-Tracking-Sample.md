# Task 007: Create Action Tracking Tutorial and Sample

## Description

Create a step-by-step tutorial in the README explaining how to implement Action Tracking, followed by creating a sample application that demonstrates these concepts. This will help developers understand how to utilize the Action Tracking Feature from TimeWarp.State.Plus in their applications.

## Requirements

Phase 1 - Tutorial Creation:
- Create a detailed tutorial in the README that explains:
  - What Action Tracking is and its benefits
  - How to use the existing ActionTrackingState from TimeWarp.State.Plus
  - Step-by-step guide for implementing tracked actions
  - How to display and manage action tracking information

Phase 2 - Sample Implementation:
- Create a sample application based on Sample00Wasm that implements the concepts from the tutorial
- Demonstrate practical usage of action tracking features

## Checklist

### Phase 1 - Tutorial
- [ ] Research and outline tutorial structure
- [ ] Document Action Tracking concept overview
- [ ] Write step-by-step implementation guide:
  - [ ] Adding TimeWarp.State.Plus package
  - [ ] Creating trackable actions
  - [ ] Using TrackActionAttribute
  - [ ] Configuring ActionTrackingBehavior
  - [ ] Displaying tracking information
- [ ] Include code snippets and examples
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section
- [ ] Review and refine tutorial content

### Phase 2 - Sample Implementation
- [ ] Create new sample project based on Sample00Wasm
- [ ] Implement features following tutorial steps:
  - [ ] Create State with tracked actions
  - [ ] Implement sample actions (TwoSecondAction, FiveSecondAction)
  - [ ] Add tracking configuration
  - [ ] Create UI components
- [ ] Verify implementation matches tutorial
- [ ] Test and validate functionality

### Documentation
- [ ] Update main documentation to reference tutorial
- [ ] Add inline code comments
- [ ] Create sample project README
- [ ] Add usage examples

### Review
- [ ] Review tutorial clarity and completeness
- [ ] Test tutorial steps for accuracy
- [ ] Verify sample implementation
- [ ] Review code quality
- [ ] Test build and run process

## Notes

Reference implementations:
- Tests/Test.App/Test.App.Client/Pages/ActiveActionsPage.razor
- Source/TimeWarp.State.Plus/Features/ActionTracking/ActionTrackingState/ActionTrackingState.cs
- Source/TimeWarp.State.Plus/Features/ActionTracking/Pipeline/ActionTrackingBehavior.cs
- Source/TimeWarp.State.Plus/Features/ActionTracking/Pipeline/TrackActionAttribute.cs

Tutorial should cover:
- Action Tracking concept explanation
- Using existing ActionTrackingState
- Creating trackable actions
- Implementing tracking display
- Error handling
- Best practices

Sample should demonstrate:
- Practical implementation of tutorial concepts
- Multiple action duration scenarios
- Concurrent action handling
- Error handling scenarios

## Implementation Notes

Tutorial considerations:
1. Focus on clarity and step-by-step progression
2. Include practical examples
3. Explain why each step is necessary
4. Address common pitfalls

Sample considerations:
1. Follow tutorial structure exactly
2. Demonstrate practical usage
3. Include error handling examples
4. Show concurrent action tracking
