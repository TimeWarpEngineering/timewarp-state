# The Backlog

This is a text based system. You may be surprised how productive text files and checklists are.
The learning curve is low and flexibility is high.

All hierarchy of the backlog is maintained with just folders.
If you need to group something for clarity add a folder.

For single contributor projects or OSS software that you do in your 
spare time, start off with a single Todo.md and a Done.md (If you want) with no iterations.

It's simple and gets you started. Once public you will have Github Issues etc to use.
