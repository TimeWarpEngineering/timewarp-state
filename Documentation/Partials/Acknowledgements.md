## Acknowledgements

Jimmy Bogard ([MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR)).
Jimmy is an amazing developer and knowledge sharer.  
Through his course at [11x Engieering](https://11xengineering.com/),
his many blog posts on Los Techies and now [JimmyBogard.com](https://jimmybogard.com/),
I have learned a great amount.

Peter Morris ([Blazor-Fluxor](https://github.com/mrpmorris/blazor-fluxor)). Pete and I
have been friends for many years. He is an amazing developer and a person who has taught me a great deal.
Not surprisingly, Pete and I think a lot alike.
We both, independently, started working on our own State Management
components. Although I started first :P (By like a few days).
Pete's component attempts to solve most of the same problems.
Blazor-State draws on the strengths of a proven pipeline in MediatR where Fluxor
implements its own middle-ware.  
If Blazor-State does not meet your needs be sure to checkout Fluxor.

Tor Hovland ([Blazor-Redux](https://github.com/torhovland/blazor-redux)).
I have only know Tor for a short time via the Blazor Gitter channel but he is already stimulating ideas.
If you use F# and need state management functionality checkout his library.
